# robotics-ros2
This is a project I competed for my introductory mobile robotics course, in this coursework, I implemented a particle filter that is robust to randomness such as the kidnapped robot problem. I only implemented the pf.py file, while the other files are given by my course instructor. A report has been included talking about my design choices and code walk-through.
